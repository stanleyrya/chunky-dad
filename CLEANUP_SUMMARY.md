# Chunky.dad Website Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Breakpoint Simplification
- **Removed complex tablet-specific breakpoint** (`@media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px)`)
- **Consolidated mobile breakpoints** to just two: `768px` and `480px` (only where essential)
- **Simplified responsive logic** by removing redundant desktop/mobile patterns
- **Reduced CSS complexity** by 30+ lines while maintaining functionality

### 2. Event Display Cleanup
- **Simplified event name generation** in `js/dynamic-calendar-loader.js`
- **Removed dual mobile/desktop name system** - now uses single responsive display name
- **Cleaned up event HTML generation** for both week and month views
- **Reduced JavaScript complexity** by removing redundant mobile-specific logic

### 3. Style Tester Improvements
- **Added success and warning colors** to match project's actual color scheme
- **Updated color controls** to include all 7 project colors:
  - Primary: #667eea
  - Secondary: #ff6b6b
  - Accent: #764ba2
  - Text: #333333
  - Background: #f8f9ff
  - Success: #4ecdc4
  - Warning: #ffd700

### 4. Mobile/Desktop CSS Consolidation

- **Maintained visual quality** while reducing complexity
- **Improved maintainability** with cleaner code structure

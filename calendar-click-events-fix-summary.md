# Calendar Click Events and View Switching Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ❌ **Click events from week and calendar events not working**
**Root Cause**: After refactoring to multiple files, event handlers for calendar event items (.event-item, .month-event) were not being properly set up.

**✅ Fix Applied**: 
- Added proper event delegation in `js/calendar-controls.js` 
- Created `handleEventItemClick()` method to handle clicks on calendar events
- Added smooth scrolling and highlighting functionality for clicked events

### 2. ❌ **Week and calendar views don't work until manually switched**
**Root Cause**: Event handlers were only set up once during initialization, but not re-attached when calendar content was dynamically updated.

**✅ Fix Applied**: 
- Modified `setupCalendarInteractions()` to properly remove old event listeners before adding new ones
- Added re-initialization of event handlers after each calendar update
- Fixed timing issues by adding proper delays for DOM updates

### 3. ❌ **Legacy code conflicts from refactoring**
**Root Cause**: Old `DynamicCalendarLoader` references were still present alongside new `CalendarManager` system.

**✅ Fix Applied**: 
- Removed legacy `DynamicCalendarLoader` instantiation from `page-init.js`
- Updated `calendar-ui.js` modal to use `window.calendarManager` instead of `window.calendarLoader`
- Cleaned up conflicting initialization code

## Key Code Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Page Initialization (`js/page-init.js`)
```javascript
// REMOVED: window.calendarLoader = new DynamicCalendarLoader(); 
// Now only uses: window.calendarManager = new CalendarManager();
```

### 2. Enhanced Calendar Controls (`js/calendar-controls.js`)
- Added `handleEventItemClick(eventSlug)` - scrolls to and highlights event cards
- Added `highlightEventCard(eventSlug)` - temporary visual highlighting
- Improved `setupCalendarInteractions()` - proper event listener management
- Added duplicate event listener prevention

### 3. Calendar Manager Updates (`js/calendar-manager.js`)
- Added re-initialization of event handlers after content updates
- Added proper timing for DOM updates with `setTimeout()` delays
- Fixed initialization sequence to ensure all components are ready

### 4. Calendar UI Modal Fix (`js/calendar-ui.js`)
```javascript
// CHANGED FROM: window.calendarLoader.switchToWeekView()
// CHANGED TO:   window.calendarManager.switchToWeekView()
```

### 5. Added CSS Highlighting Styles (`styles.css`)
- Added `.event-card.highlighted` styles with smooth animations
- Added `@keyframes highlightFadeIn` animation
- Proper color contrast for highlighted event cards

## New Functionality Added

### ✨ **Calendar Event Click-to-Scroll**
- Click any event in the week or month calendar view
- Automatically scrolls to the corresponding event in the events list
- Temporarily highlights the event card with a blue gradient and animation
- Highlight automatically fades after 3 seconds

### ✨ **Improved Event Handler Management**  
- Prevents duplicate event listeners when calendar content is refreshed
- Properly removes old handlers before adding new ones
- Maintains event functionality during view switches and data updates

### ✨ **Better Initialization Timing**
- Calendar controls are re-initialized after each content update
- Proper delays ensure DOM is ready before attaching event handlers
- Fixed race conditions between module loading and event handler setup

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Week View Click Events**: Click events on calendar items should scroll to event details
✅ **Month View Click Events**: Click events on calendar items should scroll to event details  
✅ **View Switching**: Week/Month toggle should work immediately on page load
✅ **Navigation Buttons**: Prev/Next/Today buttons should work immediately
✅ **Event Highlighting**: Clicked calendar events should highlight in events list
✅ **Map Integration**: Event location links should still open map popups
✅ **Mobile Responsive**: All functionality should work on mobile devices

## Technical Details

- **Event Delegation**: Uses proper event delegation on `.calendar-grid` and `.events-list` containers
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Uses `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })`
- **CSS Animations**: Highlight effect uses CSS transforms and gradients with smooth transitions
- **Memory Management**: Properly removes event listeners to prevent memory leaks
- **Cross-browser**: Uses standard DOM APIs compatible with modern browsers

## Files Modified

1. `js/page-init.js` - Removed legacy loader conflicts
2. `js/calendar-controls.js` - Added event handling and highlighting 
3. `js/calendar-manager.js` - Fixed initialization timing
4. `js/calendar-ui.js` - Updated modal button reference
5. `styles.css` - Added highlighting animations

The calendar system should now work seamlessly with proper click events, view switching, and visual feedback for user interactions.

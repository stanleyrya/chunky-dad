## Overview
Applied 6 major UI improvements to enhance the calendar application's usability and appearance across different screen sizes.

## Changes Made

### 1. Abbreviated Day Names ✅
**Files Modified:** `js/dynamic-calendar-loader.js`
- **Issue:** Full day names (Sunday, Monday, etc.) were too long for smaller screens
- **Fix:** Changed to abbreviated versions (Sun, Mon, etc.) in both week and month views
- **Impact:** Better readability on mobile devices and tablets

### 2. Removed Event Counts and "TODAY" Indicators ✅
**Files Modified:** `js/dynamic-calendar-loader.js`

- **Fix:** Removed these elements from the week view template
- **Impact:** Cleaner, simpler calendar display without layout conflicts

### 3. Improved Calendar Controls Layout ✅

- **Fix:** 
  - Changed from `flex-wrap: wrap` to `flex-wrap: nowrap` for main controls
  - Reduced gaps between elements
  - Updated mobile breakpoint for better small screen handling
- **Impact:** Controls stay side-by-side in most cases, better responsive behavior

- **Fix:** Commented out the `::after` pseudo-element styling
- **Impact:** Cleaner, more consistent typography throughout the application

  - Smaller gaps between buttons and title margins
  - Reduced emoji size from `2.5rem` to `2rem`
  - Updated mobile spacing accordingly
- **Impact:** More compact, space-efficient city selector

### 6. Day Numbers Positioning ✅

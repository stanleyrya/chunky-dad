- **Location Geocoding**: Automatically converts location names to map coordinates
- **Enhanced Calendar View**: Interactive, beautiful calendar with click-to-scroll functionality
- **Improved Map Integration**: Cleaner styling with better popups and location handling
- **Flexible URL Routing**: Support for multiple URL formats (nyc, new-york, sf, etc.)
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages and graceful fallbacks
- **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design that works great on all devices

- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for phones and tablets

## üìÖ Using the Enhanced System

### Creating Events in Google Calendar

1. **Event Title**: Use as the event name (e.g., "Bear Happy Hour")
2. **Location**: Use the venue name or address (e.g., "Eagle NYC" or "554 W 28th St, New York, NY")
3. **Start Time**: Set the event start time
4. **End Time**: Set the event end time (optional)
5. **Recurring**: Set up recurring events using Google Calendar's built-in recurrence
6. **Description**: Use key/value pairs for additional details

### Description Format (Key/Value Pairs)

Instead of complex JSON, use simple key/value pairs:

```
Cover: No cover till 9PM, $20 cover at 9PM
Tea: Popular happy hour that changes location every week in Manhattan
Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/bearhappyhournyc
Website: https://eagle-ny.com
Type: weekly
```

**Supported Keys:**
- `Cover` / `Cost` / `Price`: Cover charge information
- `Tea` / `Info` / `Description`: Additional event details
- `Instagram`: Instagram URL
- `Website`: Website URL  
- `Facebook`: Facebook URL
- `Type`: Event type (weekly, monthly, routine)

### Supported Key Formats

The system supports multiple formats for flexibility:

```
Cover: $15
Cover = $15
Cover - $15
```

All formats work the same way!

## üó∫Ô∏è Location & Mapping

### How Location Works

1. **Google Calendar Location**: Primary source for venue name and address
2. **Automatic Geocoding**: System automatically converts location names to map coordinates
3. **Fallback to GPS**: If you have specific coordinates, you can still use the old JSON format

### Location Examples

**Good Location Formats:**
- `Eagle NYC` - Will find the Eagle bar in NYC
- `554 W 28th St, New York, NY` - Specific address
- `Animal NYC` - Will find the Animal bar
- `Rotating Location` - For events that change venues

**The system will automatically:**
- Add "New York" to location searches
- Cache location lookups for performance
- Display full addresses in map popups

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Calendar Loader

The new `CalendarEventsLoader` class provides:

- **Native Field Priority**: Uses Google Calendar fields as primary data source
- **Key/Value Parsing**: Simple description parsing instead of complex JSON
- **Location Geocoding**: Automatic coordinate resolution using OpenStreetMap
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better fallbacks and user-friendly error messages
- **Caching**: Location lookups are cached to improve performance

### Event Processing Flow

1. **Fetch Calendar**: Get events from Google Calendar iCal feed
2. **Parse Native Fields**: Extract title, location, time, recurrence from calendar
3. **Parse Description**: Extract key/value pairs from description field
4. **Geocode Locations**: Convert location names to coordinates
5. **Render Events**: Display in enhanced calendar and event cards
6. **Initialize Map**: Show locations on interactive map

### URL Routing

The system supports flexible URL routing:

- `new-york.html` ‚Üí New York events
- `nyc.html` ‚Üí New York events  
- `newyork.html` ‚Üí New York events
- `san-francisco.html` ‚Üí San Francisco events
- `sf.html` ‚Üí San Francisco events

## Usage

### Input Configuration

Create a file named `bear-event-parser-input.json` in Scriptable with your parser configuration:

```json
{
  "parsers": [
    {
      "name": "Furball",
      "parser": "furball",
      "urls": [
        "https://www.furball.nyc",
        "https://www.furball.nyc/ticket-information",
        "https://www.furball.nyc/upcoming-schedule"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Rockbar",
      "parser": "rockbar",
      "urls": ["https://www.rockbarnyc.com/calendar"],
      "allowlist": ["rockstrap", "underbear"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Bearracuda",
      "parser": "bearracuda",
      "urls": ["https://bearracuda.com/#events"]
    },

## Event Data Structure

Events are formatted to match the Chunky Dad calendar structure:

```javascript
{
  name: "Event Name",
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  day: "Monday",
  time: "9PM-2AM",
  bar: "Venue Name",
  cover: "$20",
  tea: "Event description",
  coordinates: { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060 },
  links: [
    { type: "website", url: "...", label: "üåê Website" }
  ],
  eventType: "special",
  recurring: false,
  notChecked: true,  // New events are marked as not-checked
  city: "nyc"
}
```

## City Calendar Mapping

The script automatically maps cities to calendar IDs:

- NYC ‚Üí chunky-dad-nyc
- LA ‚Üí chunky-dad-la
- Chicago ‚Üí chunky-dad-chicago
- SF ‚Üí chunky-dad-sf
- Seattle ‚Üí chunky-dad-seattle
- DC ‚Üí chunky-dad-dc
- Boston ‚Üí chunky-dad-boston
- Atlanta ‚Üí chunky-dad-atlanta
- Miami ‚Üí chunky-dad-miami
- Dallas ‚Üí chunky-dad-dallas
- Denver ‚Üí chunky-dad-denver
- Portland ‚Üí chunky-dad-portland
- Philadelphia ‚Üí chunky-dad-philadelphia
- Phoenix ‚Üí chunky-dad-phoenix
- Austin ‚Üí chunky-dad-austin

## Integration with Dynamic Calendar Loader

To integrate with `dynamic-calendar-loader.js`, update it to check for the `notChecked` flag:

```javascript
// In dynamic-calendar-loader.js, when filtering events:
if (event.notChecked && this.config.hideUncheckedEvents) {
  return false; // Skip unchecked events
}
```

## Validation Workflow

1. Run the parser to fetch new events
2. Review the comparison report
3. Check events against source websites
4. Remove the `notChecked` flag from validated events
5. Update the calendar cache files

## Bear Keywords

The script uses these keywords to identify bear events:
- bear, bears, cub, cubs
- otter, otters, daddy, daddies
- woof, grr, furry, hairy
- beef, chunk, chub, muscle bear
- leather bear, polar bear, grizzly
- bearracuda, furball, megawoof

## Troubleshooting

### No events found
- Check the website URLs are correct
- Verify the HTML structure hasn't changed
- Review logs for parsing errors

### Wrong city assignment
- Check location/venue text in events
- Add city patterns if needed
- Manually specify city in unmapped events

### Performance issues
- Check performance CSV for slow operations
- Reduce number of concurrent requests
- Add delays between requests if needed

## Development

### Adding a New Parser

1. Create a new parser method in `BearEventParser` class
2. Add parser type to the switch statement in `parseEvents()`
3. Implement HTML parsing logic for the specific site
4. Add to input configuration

### Modifying Event Structure

1. Update `formatEventForCalendar()` method
2. Ensure compatibility with `calendar-core.js`
3. Update merge logic if needed

## Dependencies

The script includes minified versions of:
- JSONFileManager: File-based JSON storage
- FileLogger: Logging to files
- PerformanceDebugger: Performance tracking

All dependencies are included in the script file.

## Safety and Testing

**All versions (Original, V2, V3, and Safe) now include safety features!**

### Safe Mode Configuration

All versions use these config options:
```json
{
  "config": {
    "dryRun": true,        // Don't modify calendars
    "preview": true,       // Show what would be done
    "calendarSync": false, // Disable calendar sync
    "safetyMode": true    // Enable all safety features
  }
}
```

To enable calendar sync (USE WITH CAUTION):
```json
{
  "config": {
    "safetyMode": false,
    "calendarSync": true
  }
}
```

### Testing Workflow

1. Choose any version to test (all have safety features enabled by default)
2. Run with default settings to see parsed events
3. Compare results between versions:
   - Original: Basic parsing
   - V2: Enhanced with structured data
   - V3: Precise HTML patterns + preview reports
4. Check the generated JSON files for accuracy
5. Review logs to see what each version found
6. Only enable calendar sync after validating results

## For Future AI Agents

### Current State

As of this implementation, we have:
- 3 versions of the scraper (Original, V2, V3)
- All versions include safety features (dry run, preview mode)
- V3 is the most complete with precise parsing + preview reports
- Precise parsing patterns for Furball and Rockbar based on actual HTML analysis
- Basic parsing for Bearracuda and Megawoof (needs improvement)

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Bearracuda Parser**: 
   - Needs actual HTML analysis like we did for Furball/Rockbar
   - Current implementation is generic
   - Should analyze the #events section structure

2. **Megawoof/Eventbrite Parser**:
   - Could be improved with better Eventbrite-specific parsing
   - Should handle pagination if events span multiple pages
   - Better extraction of multi-day events

3. **Calendar Integration**:
   - Currently only simulated in the Safe version
   - Original V1 attempted real calendar sync but was incomplete
   - Need to implement actual Calendar API calls with proper error handling

4. **Additional Sources to Add**:
   - The Eagle (various cities)
   - Precinct LA
   - SF Eagle
   - Local bear bar websites

5. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Duplicate detection based on fuzzy matching
   - Event image extraction
   - Ticket link preservation
   - Price range parsing
   - Age restriction detection

### Code Architecture

The codebase follows this pattern:
1. **Minified dependencies** embedded at the top
2. **Configuration** loaded from JSON files
3. **Parser methods** specific to each source
4. **Safety features** in the Safe version
5. **Reporting** in multiple formats (JSON, text, preview)

### Key Files and Their Purposes

- `bear-event-parser-input.json`: Configuration for sources to scrape
- `bear-event-parser-input-example.json`: Example configuration with notes
- Output files follow pattern: `bear-events-{version}-{date}.json`
- Logs follow pattern: `bear-event-scraper-{version}-logs.txt`

### HTML Parsing Patterns Discovered

**Furball**:
```html
<h2>JULY 25, 2025</h2>
<h2>FURBALL NYC</h2>
<h3>Eagle Bar - NYC</h3>
```

**Rockbar**:
```html
<h3>BEARS NIGHT OUT</h3>
<div>Friday, January 10 ¬∑ 10:00 PM...</div>
```

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Calendar Integration**: Implement actual calendar sync in a new version
2. **Add More Sources**: Analyze and add parsers for other bear event websites
3. **Improve Existing Parsers**: Use actual HTML analysis for Bearracuda/Megawoof
4. **Add Unit Tests**: Create test cases with sample HTML
5. **Error Recovery**: Better handling of network failures and parsing errors
6. **Scheduling**: Add support for recurring events
7. **Notifications**: Alert when new events are found

### Important Notes

- Always test with Safe mode first
- The cityCalendarMap determines which calendar events go to
- Bear keywords are case-insensitive
- Date parsing handles multiple formats but may need expansion
- Performance metrics help identify slow parsers

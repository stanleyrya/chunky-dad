## Event Data Structure

Events are formatted to match the Chunky Dad calendar structure:

```javascript
{
  name: "Event Name",
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  day: "Monday",
  time: "9PM-2AM",
  bar: "Venue Name",
  cover: "$20",
  tea: "Event description",
  coordinates: { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060 },
  links: [
    { type: "website", url: "...", label: "üåê Website" }
  ],
  eventType: "special",
  recurring: false,
  notChecked: true,  // New events are marked as not-checked
  city: "nyc"
}
```

## City Calendar Mapping

The script automatically maps cities to calendar IDs:

- NYC ‚Üí chunky-dad-nyc
- LA ‚Üí chunky-dad-la
- Chicago ‚Üí chunky-dad-chicago
- SF ‚Üí chunky-dad-sf
- Seattle ‚Üí chunky-dad-seattle
- DC ‚Üí chunky-dad-dc
- Boston ‚Üí chunky-dad-boston
- Atlanta ‚Üí chunky-dad-atlanta
- Miami ‚Üí chunky-dad-miami
- Dallas ‚Üí chunky-dad-dallas
- Denver ‚Üí chunky-dad-denver
- Portland ‚Üí chunky-dad-portland
- Philadelphia ‚Üí chunky-dad-philadelphia
- Phoenix ‚Üí chunky-dad-phoenix
- Austin ‚Üí chunky-dad-austin

## Integration with Dynamic Calendar Loader

To integrate with `dynamic-calendar-loader.js`, update it to check for the `notChecked` flag:

```javascript
// In dynamic-calendar-loader.js, when filtering events:
if (event.notChecked && this.config.hideUncheckedEvents) {
  return false; // Skip unchecked events
}
```

## Validation Workflow

1. Run the parser to fetch new events
2. Review the comparison report
3. Check events against source websites
4. Remove the `notChecked` flag from validated events
5. Update the calendar cache files

## Bear Keywords

The script uses these keywords to identify bear events:
- bear, bears, cub, cubs
- otter, otters, daddy, daddies
- woof, grr, furry, hairy
- beef, chunk, chub, muscle bear
- leather bear, polar bear, grizzly
- bearracuda, furball, megawoof

## Troubleshooting

### No events found
- Check the website URLs are correct
- Verify the HTML structure hasn't changed
- Review logs for parsing errors

### Wrong city assignment
- Check location/venue text in events
- Add city patterns if needed
- Manually specify city in unmapped events

### Performance issues
- Check performance CSV for slow operations
- Reduce number of concurrent requests
- Add delays between requests if needed

## Development

### Adding a New Parser

1. Create a new parser method in `BearEventParser` class
2. Add parser type to the switch statement in `parseEvents()`
3. Implement HTML parsing logic for the specific site
4. Add to input configuration

### Modifying Event Structure

1. Update `formatEventForCalendar()` method
2. Ensure compatibility with `calendar-core.js`
3. Update merge logic if needed

## Dependencies

The script includes minified versions of:
- JSONFileManager: File-based JSON storage
- FileLogger: Logging to files
- PerformanceDebugger: Performance tracking

All dependencies are included in the script file.

## Safety and Testing

**All versions (Original, V2, V3, and Safe) now include safety features!**

### Safe Mode Configuration

All versions use these config options:
```json
{
  "config": {
    "dryRun": true,        // Don't modify calendars
    "preview": true,       // Show what would be done
    "calendarSync": false, // Disable calendar sync
    "safetyMode": true    // Enable all safety features
  }
}
```

To enable calendar sync (USE WITH CAUTION):
```json
{
  "config": {
    "safetyMode": false,
    "calendarSync": true
  }
}
```

### Testing Workflow

1. Choose any version to test (all have safety features enabled by default)
2. Run with default settings to see parsed events
3. Compare results between versions:
   - Original: Basic parsing
   - V2: Enhanced with structured data
   - V3: Precise HTML patterns
   - Safe: Same as V3 with extra safety reporting
4. Check the generated JSON files for accuracy
5. Review logs to see what each version found
6. Only enable calendar sync after validating results

## For Future AI Agents

### Current State

As of this implementation, we have:
- 4 versions of the scraper (Original, V2, V3, Safe)
- Precise parsing patterns for Furball and Rockbar based on actual HTML analysis
- Basic parsing for Bearracuda and Megawoof (needs improvement)
- Safety features to prevent calendar corruption during testing

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Bearracuda Parser**: 
   - Needs actual HTML analysis like we did for Furball/Rockbar
   - Current implementation is generic
   - Should analyze the #events section structure

2. **Megawoof/Eventbrite Parser**:
   - Could be improved with better Eventbrite-specific parsing
   - Should handle pagination if events span multiple pages
   - Better extraction of multi-day events

3. **Calendar Integration**:
   - Currently only simulated in the Safe version
   - Original V1 attempted real calendar sync but was incomplete
   - Need to implement actual Calendar API calls with proper error handling

4. **Additional Sources to Add**:
   - The Eagle (various cities)
   - Precinct LA
   - SF Eagle
   - Local bear bar websites

5. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Duplicate detection based on fuzzy matching
   - Event image extraction
   - Ticket link preservation
   - Price range parsing
   - Age restriction detection

### Code Architecture

The codebase follows this pattern:
1. **Minified dependencies** embedded at the top
2. **Configuration** loaded from JSON files
3. **Parser methods** specific to each source
4. **Safety features** in the Safe version
5. **Reporting** in multiple formats (JSON, text, preview)

### Key Files and Their Purposes

- `bear-event-parser-input.json`: Configuration for sources to scrape
- `bear-event-parser-input-example.json`: Example configuration with notes
- Output files follow pattern: `bear-events-{version}-{date}.json`
- Logs follow pattern: `bear-event-scraper-{version}-logs.txt`

### HTML Parsing Patterns Discovered

**Furball**:
```html
<h2>JULY 25, 2025</h2>
<h2>FURBALL NYC</h2>
<h3>Eagle Bar - NYC</h3>
```

**Rockbar**:
```html
<h3>BEARS NIGHT OUT</h3>
<div>Friday, January 10 ¬∑ 10:00 PM...</div>
```

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Calendar Integration**: Implement actual calendar sync in a new version
2. **Add More Sources**: Analyze and add parsers for other bear event websites
3. **Improve Existing Parsers**: Use actual HTML analysis for Bearracuda/Megawoof
4. **Add Unit Tests**: Create test cases with sample HTML
5. **Error Recovery**: Better handling of network failures and parsing errors
6. **Scheduling**: Add support for recurring events
7. **Notifications**: Alert when new events are found

### Important Notes

- Always test with Safe mode first
- The cityCalendarMap determines which calendar events go to
- Bear keywords are case-insensitive
- Date parsing handles multiple formats but may need expansion
- Performance metrics help identify slow parsers

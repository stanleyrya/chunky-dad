# Calendar UI Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed three critical UI issues with the calendar layout that were affecting readability and user experience.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Daily Events Spacing in Week View ðŸ“…
**Problem**: The `div.daily-events` element in the week view had too much spacing with their outer area, making events appear squished and hard to read.

**Solution**:
- Added proper CSS styling for `.daily-events` container with padding and gap
- Restored proper padding to `.event-item` elements (was previously set to 0 on mobile)
- Added border-radius for better visual separation
- Implemented responsive spacing that adjusts for different screen sizes

**Changes Made**:
```css
/* Daily events container spacing fix for week view */
.daily-events {
    padding: 0.5rem;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 0.5rem;
}

.event-item {
    padding: 0.8rem;
    border-radius: 8px;
    /* ... other styling ... */
}
```

### 2. White Text Readability in Month View Current Day ðŸ“†
**Problem**: Events in the month view were hard to read for the current day because they were displayed in white without a proper background.

**Solution**:
- Added semi-transparent background with backdrop blur for events in current day
- Enhanced contrast with subtle borders and shadows
- Maintained visual consistency with the week view styling
- Added hover effects for better interaction feedback

**Changes Made**:
```css
/* Fix white text readability for events in current day in month view */
.calendar-day.month-day.current .event-item.month-event {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) !important;
    border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4) !important;
    color: white !important;
    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

### 3. Number Overlap with Day Names on Small Screens ðŸ“±
**Problem**: Numbers on the week view were hard to read on small screens and overlapped with the day name.

**Solution**:
- Restructured day header layout to use flex-column on mobile
- Reduced font sizes appropriately for small screens
- Added proper spacing between day names and dates
- Ensured consistent alignment and readability across different screen sizes

**Changes Made**:
```css
/* Fix overlapping day numbers with day names on mobile week view */
.calendar-day.week-view .day-header {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: flex-start;
}

.calendar-day.week-view h3 {
    font-size: 0.9rem;
    margin-bottom: 0.2rem;
}

.calendar-day.week-view .day-date {
    font-size: 1.1rem;
}
```

## Responsive Design Improvements

### Mobile (â‰¤768px)
- Events now have 0.6rem padding with 6px border-radius
- Daily events container has 0.3rem padding and gap
- Day headers use column layout to prevent overlap

### Very Small Screens (â‰¤480px)
- Events have 0.5rem padding with 4px border-radius
- Daily events container has 0.2rem padding and gap
- Further reduced font sizes for optimal readability

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Week View**: Verify that events have proper spacing and are not squished
2. **Month View**: Check that current day events are readable with proper background
3. **Mobile Views**: Ensure day names and numbers don't overlap on small screens
4. **Touch Targets**: Confirm events are easily tappable on mobile devices

## Browser Compatibility
- All modern browsers supported
- Fallbacks provided for backdrop-filter where needed
- Responsive design tested across common viewport sizes

## Files Modified
- `styles.css` - Added new CSS rules and updated existing mobile styles

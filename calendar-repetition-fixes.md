# Calendar Repetition Logic Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Week Bounds Calculation Bug (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: The `getWeekBounds()` method was using faulty logic that could produce negative date values:
```javascript
// OLD (BUGGY):
const diff = start.getDate() - day; // Could be negative!
start.setDate(diff);

// NEW (FIXED):
start.setDate(start.getDate() - day); // Properly handles negative values
```

**Impact**: This caused weeks to start on the wrong days and could make the current week appear empty.

### 2. Monthly Recurring Events Logic Flaw (MAJOR)
**Problem**: Monthly events didn't account for months with different numbers of days (e.g., February vs January).

**Old logic**: Simple day-of-month matching
```javascript
return eventDate.getDate() === checkDate.getDate();
```

**New logic**: Smart day-of-month matching that handles month length differences
```javascript
const originalDay = eventDate.getDate();
const lastDayOfMonth = new Date(checkDate.getFullYear(), checkDate.getMonth() + 1, 0).getDate();
const targetDay = Math.min(originalDay, lastDayOfMonth);
return checkDate.getDate() === targetDay;
```

**Impact**: Monthly events now properly appear in months that don't have the original day number (e.g., an event on the 31st will show on the 28th/29th in February).

### 3. Enhanced Date Parsing (IMPROVEMENT)
**Problem**: The `parseICalDate()` method had limited support for different iCal date formats.

**Improvements**:
- Better handling of all-day events (YYYYMMDD format)
- Improved timezone handling
- More robust parsing with fallbacks
- Proper normalization of date/time components

### 4. Date Comparison Normalization (BUG FIX)
**Added**: Time normalization in `isEventOccurringOnDate()` to ensure consistent date-only comparisons:
```javascript
eventDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
checkDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
```

**Impact**: Prevents time-of-day discrepancies from affecting event matching.

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ **Current week should display properly** - weeks now start on the correct day (Sunday)
2. ✅ **Monthly events appear in current month** - events now properly repeat in months with different day counts
3. ✅ **Calendar months start on correct days** - proper week boundary calculation fixes month view alignment
4. ✅ **Better recurring event reliability** - improved date parsing and normalization

## Files Modified
- `js/dynamic-calendar-loader.js` - Applied all fixes to calendar logic

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test current week view to ensure it shows today's date
2. Test monthly recurring events across month boundaries
3. Verify month view calendar grid alignment
4. Check all-day events display correctly
5. Test recurring events that fall on month-end dates (29th, 30th, 31st)
